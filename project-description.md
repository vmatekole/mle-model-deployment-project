# Model deployment project

## Project description

In this project you will `train` and `deploy` a `machine learning model` on the `yellow taxi` dataset. The goal is to predict the `duration` of a trip.
You should use the `scikit-learn` library to train a `random forest regressor` model.
And deploy the model with one of the methods you saw this week.

## Project structure

The project is composed of 3 parts:

- Train the model with a `random forest regressor` track it with MLFlow.
- Deploy the model as an API.
- Make a request to the model.

Bonus tasks if you have the time:

Bonus: Use the testing methods you saw this week to test your data and your model.

Bonus: Use `gridsearch` or `optuna` to find the best hyperparameters for your model.

## Answer these questions

1. What is the RMSE of your model?
2. What would you do differently if you had more time?
